**Welcome to THH-Truck-Mods!**  
An open-source repository dedicated to creating DIY truck modifications using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and other accessible electronics. This collection of projects is built for anyone interested in enhancing their truck’s functionality with custom electronics, with a focus on older diesel models like the Ford 6.9/7.3 IDI.

Each mod is designed with simplicity in mind—using common components, detailed instructions, and open-source code so anyone, regardless of skill level, can follow along.

## 📂 Projects

Each project has its own folder, complete with setup guides, code, and diagrams. Here’s an overview of the current mods:

### 1. **Glow Plug Controller (Arduino)**
   - **Description**: A custom Arduino-based controller for managing glow plug timing on 6.9 and 7.3 IDI diesel engines. Configurable timing based on ambient and engine temperature helps ensure reliable starts in various weather conditions.
   - **Status**: In Progress
   - **Details**: Check out the `/GlowPlugController` directory for code, wiring diagrams, and a full build guide.

*Additional projects will be added here as they’re developed!*

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin using the mods in this repo, you’ll need a few basic tools and software. Each project folder includes specific instructions, but here are some general requirements:

- **Basic Tools**: Soldering iron, wiring tools, and basic hand tools for installation.
- **Software**:  
  - *Arduino IDE or PlatformIO* (for Arduino-based projects)
  - *Git* (for version control and code updates)

### ⚙️ General Skills
- Familiarity with automotive wiring and basic electronics knowledge will help, though each project is designed to be accessible for beginners.
